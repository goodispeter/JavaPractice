Any amount of electricity used by a customer 
(represented by an instance of the Customer class) 
must contribute to the customer's bill (represented by the member variable bill) 
through the useElectricity method.
An instance of the Customer class should never be able 
to tamper with or decrease the value of the member variable bill.
How should you write methods in the ElectricAccount class at 
line n1 so that the member variable bill 
is always equal to the value of the member variable
 kwh multiplied by the member variable rate?

 在第 n1 行的 ElectricAccount 類中，應該如編寫方法，以使成員變量 bill 的值始终等於成員變量 kwh 乘以成員變量 rate？
